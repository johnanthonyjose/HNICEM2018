Welcome to Daejeon!  We are honored to host the 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. IROS 2016 is filled with rich academic programs, social entertainment and exciting culture events. 
</p><p align="justify">
Daejeon is the leading city of science and technology in Korea, which has a large research complex with over 250 research institutes, universities, and technology companies.  It also has many cultural attractions, such as the Daejeon Culture and Arts Center, the Municipal Museum of Arts, and Baekjae (Old Kingdom of Korea in Daejeon province) Cultural Zone.  There are various attractions, such as Korean pottery, ginseng cultivation, and temple stay programs.
</p><p align="justify">
This year, the conference received 1719 paper submissions from 57 countries, and after a rigorous review process, 832 papers were accepted.  And, 36 workshops and tutorials were also accepted.  IROS 2016 provides the five types of presentations (oral, interactive, demonstration, video and highlight presentation) allowing presenters to most comfortably convey their accomplishments. 
</p><p align="justify">
Through a wide array of featured talks, we have made sure that this conference is the platform to update and share the most current issues in robotics. There are 4 plenary talks regarding AI/Deep learning, Autonomous Systems, and Medical robotics.  And, there are three follow-up special forums on those topics after the plenary talk every day in order to talk more in-depth with leading experts. For the first time in IROS history, we prepared ‘Life Time Talk’ to tap into their wisdom and philosophy of legends of the robotics community. In addition, participants can discuss current and future investment, business policy as well as technical issues of government and industry through our various forums: government forum, industry forum, futurist forum, entrepreneurship forum, and autonomous technologies forum, and RSJ-lecture. 9 keynote speeches related to following sessions will make the academic program of IROS2016 even more in-depth and interesting for participants, who want further their understanding.
</p><p align="justify">
On the other hand, there are new three competitions; autonomous drone racing, humanoid robot application challenge, and robotic grasping and manipulation challenge, which will be broadcasted by smart phones. We also expose and support robot start-ups through the ‘start-up competition’. There are more than 40 exhibitions from the world, where participants can see the most recent advancements in robot technology.  As ROBOWORLD 2016 will be held in KINTEX, Seoul from the 12th till the 15th of October you can see the exhibition of over 200 robot companies after IROS 2016.
</p><p align="justify">
Time to socialize with colleagues and potential collaborators is also vital to IROS conference. We have prepared various social programs in which participants remember Daejeon while making unforgettable experiences with other colleagues. In addition to the welcome, farewell receptions, and the banquet, we provide special events, such as the Korean Tea Culture Experience, Traditional Clothes Experience, the Tuesday Night Explore Daejeon, and sports events, such as the Dragon Boat Race and the Longest-Drive Golf Challenge at the famous virtual reality golf exercise facility, Golfzon. In particular, with the support from Daejeon Metropolitan City, all student members are invited to the banquets to experience Korea’s beautiful dynamic culture and cuisine.  
</p><p align="justify">
Special recognition must go to the Conference Paper Review Board, which handled over 5000 reviews of submitted papers, and the Senior Program Committee, which picked the very best contributions for IROS 2016.  The technical expertise of the CPRB is invaluable.  And we want to give our deepest thanks to the Daejeon Metropolitan City as well as the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, who encouraged and sponsored IROS 2016.
</p><p align="justify">
IROS 2016 definitely will become one of the most academically rich, socially entertaining, and culturally enjoyable conferences. 
</p><p align="justify">
We look forward to seeing you at the Daejeon Convention Center (DCC), Korea in October.
