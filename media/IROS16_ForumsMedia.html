2nd IEEE IROS Futurist Forum
</h3>
Sustainable Robotics for Humanity - Discussing and Shaping the Future TOGETHER<br><br>
<b>Time and Location:</b>
Tuesday, October 11, 10:15–18:00, Room 301
<br><br>
<b>Organizer:</b></i>
Dominik B.O. Boesl, Technische Universität München & KUKA AG

<p align="justify">
For the second time, globally renowned experts (including Henrik Christensen, Linda Bernardi [former Chief Innovation Officer IBM Corp.] and others) share their holistic and interdisciplinary view on the future and impact of robotics, automatization, A.I. and other disruptive technologies on the world of tomorrow. They engage in fact-based discourse with the audience and together with you - a diverse group of stakeholders - we will lay the foundation for the development of commonly accepted guidelines and frameworks on the way to voluntary self-regulation: Robotic Governance.
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Goals:</b> involve stakeholders - spark discourse - launch topic/interest groups - publish results of this and last year’s Futurist Forum - define and publish Robot Manifesto
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Contact:</b> roboticgovernance.com - info@roboticgovernance.com - @robogovernance - #RoboticGovernance - facebook.com, roboticgovernance.com
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Background:</b> Robotics will change the world! It will unleash the same if not an even more disruptive and transformational power within the next 50 years as mainstream IT-technology and the Internet have over the last half a century. Nurtured by technological breakthroughs in industrial automation, robotics will exhaustively permeate all domains of the human living realm.
</p><p align="justify">Hence, our grandchildren will grow up in a society that is enriched and enhanced by assistive technologies in every imaginable way. Robotics and automation will be tailored into many everyday objects, becoming an integral part of all kinds of appliances. This Generation ‘R’ will be without fear of these technologies perceiving their beneficial nature - they will grow up as Robotic Natives. This implies, that today’s people are already born to become the first society of Robotic Immigrants.
</p><p align="justify">Unfortunately, all technological disruptions also entail challenges and issues. But, compared to the evolution of the internet, we are facing one big chance: The internet more or less just “happened” - regarding robotics, automation and artificial intelligence we can still address possibly arising issues in advance. Involving self-regulation in the sense of Technology & Robotic Governance, these challenges have to be discussed on a broad, fact based and interdisciplinary level.
</p><p align="justify">Nevertheless, in order to enable sustainable technologies and really responsibly drive “Technology for Humanity” (as the IEEE claims), we all have to change the way we are thinking and engage in discourse!  The 2nd IEEE IROS Futurist Forum and www.roboticgovernance.com provide a platform for further exchange and discussions.

<h3>
Autonomous Systems and Their Societal Impact Forum
</h3>
<b>Time and Location:</b>
Thursday, October 13, 09:35-17:50, Room 203
<br><br>
<b>Organizer:</b></i>
Raj Madhavan (IEEE Future Directions Committee & HumRobTech, LLC, USA)
</i>
<p align="justify">
An IEEE Future Directions Committee (FDC) incubation project, entitled “Autonomous Technologies and Their Societal Impact” is bringing together industry, academia, and government to understand the current and future implications of autonomous technologies via workshops and forums consisting of presentations and panel discussions from leaders and experts in technological, legal, and public policy fields.
</p><p align="justify">
The first workshop in the series was organized at IEEE PHM’16 in Ottawa on June 20th focusing on issues relevant to North America, in general (see http://phmconf.org/autonomoustech_workshop.html). The second WS in the series is taking place at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in Stockholm on Sept. 2nd. It aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and agencies involved in areas related to autonomous technologies and their impact on society with particular attention to topics that are relevant to laws, regulations, and issues from a European perspective (see https://www.sipri.org/events/2016/workshop-autonomous-technologies).
</p><p align="justify">
Third in the series, the ATSI Forum at IROS 2016 will allow for discussion on the design of autonomous technologies and their societal impact in both positive and negative ways with particular emphasis on issues relevant to the Asia-Pacific region but not exclusively. Emphasis will be placed not only on technology and public policy issues but also on environmental, cultural, structural, political, and socio-economic factors.
</p><p align="justify">
Based on the discussions before, during, and after these workshops and forums, a White Paper consisting of ‘valid’ and ‘balanced’ concerns reflecting the state-of-the-art with an emphasis on technology and public policy issues that are representative of various stakeholders from across the globe will be published towards the end of 2016. The findings and summaries will be made available via the FDC website for other initiatives and similar efforts to use them as a reference guide to foster discussions within the community and to foster best practices.
