                                    <p>Robotics is undergoing a major transformation in scope and dimension with accelerating impact on the economy, production, and culture of our global society. The generations of robots now being developed will increasingly touch people and their lives. They will explore, work, and interact with humans in their homes, workplaces, in new production systems, and in challenging field domains. The emerging robots will provide increased support in mining, underwater, hostile environments, as well as in domestic, health, industry, and service applications. Combining the experience and cognitive abilities of the human with the strength, dependability, reach, and endurance of robots will fuel a wide range of new robotic applications. The discussion focuses on design concepts, control architectures, task primitives and strategies that bring human modeling and skill understanding to the development of this new generation of collaborative robots. </p>

                                    <p>To meet the planetary challenge of meeting the demand for food -- which is projected to increase by 70 percent by 2050 -- by a global population that will grow to approximately 9.5 billion by the middle of the century in the face of dwindling freshwater and land resources together with the severe impact of a changing climate -- innovative ways of growing food such as through vertical farms need to be linked with the tools of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to foster improved productivity, sustainability and resilience. Vertical farming -- or controlled-environment crop production in vertically stacked shelves using liquid nutrient solution and typically lit with LEDs -- provides consistently high-yields independent of climate and geography, without the use of pesticides, at less than 20 percent water consumption compared with open-field cultivaton, and while significantly curtailing both food-transport emissions and food waste. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics in vertical farming will further dramatically improve, not only its productivity, but its product quality in terms of nutrient and flavor profiles plus its labor and energy efficiencies, boosting both its economic and environmental sustainability and resilience. Cases, including the patented V-Hive Green Box and Go Vertical Farm, among others, will be presented.</p>

                                    <p>This topic introduces the design of a noise robust speech recognition system. It is suitable for speech communication robots including an AI-ROBOT. For almost all of communication robots, a strong noisy robust speech recognition has been demanded. For both of a continuous speech dialog-based and a command-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, we can design a strong robust ASR systems against various noise circumstances. </p>

                                    <p>In this presentation, advanced speech analysis techniques named psychoacoustic masking effects have been introduced. In order to develop the robustness under low SNR, Dynamic Range Adjustment (DRA) and Modulation Spectrum Control (MSC) have been developed for the robust speech features and they focus on the speech feature adjustment with an important speech components. DRA normalizes dynamic ranges and MSC eliminates the noise corruption of speech feature parameters.</p>

                                    <p>In addition to DRA and MSC, the psychoacoustic masking effects for speech feature extraction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is also introduced in this presentation. It is based on the human auditory system. Generally, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used speech features in ASR systems, and however one of their main drawbacks is background noise, which can affect and hamper the results. This presentation introduces noise robust speech features which improve upon MFCC. A psychoacoustic model-based feature extraction which simulates the perception of sound in the human auditory system is investigated and integrated into the MFCC. In this presentation, this new approach has been useful for noise robust speech recognition embedded into AI-Robots.</p>

                                    <p>Robotics science and technology have evolved from the seminal applications in industrial robotics in manufacturing to today’s varied applications in service, health care, education, entertainment and other industries including construction, mining and agriculture. One common theme in these emerging applications is the human-centered nature in unstructured environments, where robotic systems surround humans, aiding and working with us to enrich and enhance the quality of our lives. This talk presents our latest developments in fundamental capabilities in both “body” and “intelligence.” An example of self-driving cars is presented. This talk will then conclude with the challenges in science and technology to further accelerate the robotics revolution.</p>
